# AI-Powered Eco-Citizenship Platform for Carbon Footprint Reduction

## Project Overview

## Project Title: AI-Powered Eco-Citizenship Platform for Carbon Footprint Reduction

As climate change accelerates, the need to reduce individual and collective carbon footprints becomes more critical. This project leverages AI and machine learning (ML) technologies to provide an engaging, data-driven platform for individuals and communities to track and reduce their carbon emissions.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Carbon Emission Tracking**: The platform analyzes daily activities such as transportation, energy consumption, and habits to calculate carbon emissions.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Tailored suggestions for reducing emissions are provided based on user behavior.
- **Gamification**: Users earn “eco points” for sustainable actions like using public transportation, renewable energy, or reducing waste. These points can be redeemed for various rewards.
- **Community Impact Mapping**: Track and compare eco-footprints at the community level to promote competition and collaboration.
- **Business, Government, and NGO Partnerships**: Incentives for eco-friendly behaviors are offered through collaborations with organizations.

## Tech Stack

- **AI/ML**: IBM Watson, IBM Cloud Pak for Data
- **Data Sources**: NASA Earth Data, EPA Carbon Emissions Data
- **Platform**: Built on IBM Cloud

## Project Structure

- **Frontend**: The user interface allows individuals to input their data and track eco-points. It also includes visualizations of personal and community carbon footprints.
- **Backend**: The backend processes data from user activities and public datasets, providing real-time feedback and recommendations.
- **Database**: Stores user data, eco-point history, and community footprint metrics.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/eco-citizenship-platform.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
